Then, after observind data does not follow a normal distribution a non-parametrical test, Mann-Whitney U Test, was selected and applied. The resulting p-value leaded to reject the null hypothesis (stating no difference between rides when it's raining vs it's not raining) with high level of confidence `(2*p-value<0.05)`.\n",

This is a big issue for the analysis here made.** May is popular known as a 'nice wheater month' all around the globe, thus trying to figure out if people would ride more or less NYC subway using a single month does not seem reasonable. It would be better to have good data from all months during all seasons.\n",
    ">2. Further data analysis, verification and fixes may be required. For instance, by reading discussions at Udacity site, it's possible to find some potential flaws (like lot amount of entries in one hour followed by immediate almost nobody some minutes after. I haven't investigated in detail the data neither discussed or verified how the data was collected.\n",
